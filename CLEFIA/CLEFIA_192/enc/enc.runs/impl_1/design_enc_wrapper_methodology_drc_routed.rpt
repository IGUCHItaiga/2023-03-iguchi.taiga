2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
RTGT-1#1 Advisory
RAM retargeting possibility  
Identified 6 RAM32X1D primitives that could be retargeted to RAM32M. Retargeting will save approximately 2 memory LUTs and improve routability. These can usually be achieved using synthesis inference or XPMs. The memories are design_enc_i/clefia_enc_0/inst/control_s_axi_U/int_ct/mem_reg_0_3_0_0,
design_enc_i/clefia_enc_0/inst/control_s_axi_U/int_ct/mem_reg_0_3_1_1,
